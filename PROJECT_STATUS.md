## How to Run

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api
- H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console

### Option 2: Local Development

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
mvn clean compile
mvn test
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`
The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`
